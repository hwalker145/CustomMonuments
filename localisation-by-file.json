            "FU_Monument_Events.1.d": "The Brandenburg Gate is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin, built on the orders of Prussian king [Root.Monarch.GetName] to celebrate the brilliance and affluence of our people. One of the best-known landmarks of Germany, it was built on the site of a former city gate that marked the start of the road from Berlin to the town of Brandenburg an der Havel, which used to be capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. \\n\\nThe new gate was commissioned by [Root.Monarch.GetName] to represent peace and was originally named the Peace Gate. The gate consists of twelve Doric columns, six to each side, forming five passageways. Citizens were originally allowed to use only the outermost two on each side. Its design is based on the Propylaea, the gateway to the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, and is consistent with Berlin's history of architectural classicism (first, Baroque, and then neo-Palladian). The gate was the first element of a \"new Athens on the River Spree\" by local famed architects. Atop the gate is a sculpture by Johann Gottfried 'Schadow of a Quadriga' - a chariot drawn by four horses - driven by Victoria, the Roman goddess of victory.",

In 1613 the Globe burned to the ground after the thatched roof was set alight by cannonfire during a production of Henry VIII; it was rebuilt on the same site in 1614 and continued in operation until closed by the Puritans in 1642. Although its exact dimensions are unrecorded, it is known that the Globe Theatre was a three-story, circular, open-air amphitheater roughly 30 meters (100 feet) in diameter and able to seat about 300 spectators. The stage was 13 meters (43 feet) wide, 8 meters (27 feet) deep and raised five feet off the ground, allowing for trap doors.",

The earliest parts of the palace were built around 1900 BC in an area that had been used for ritual feasting since the Neolithic. The palace was continually renovated and expanded over the next five centuries until its final destruction around 1350 BC.",

In the 17th century, the Maxwells were created Earls of Nithsdale, and built a new lodging within the walls, described as among \"the most ambitious early classical domestic architecture in Scotland\" . In 1640 the castle was besieged for the last time by the Protestant Covenanter army and was subsequently abandoned. Although demolished and rebuilt several times, the castle retains the distinctive triangular plan first laid out in the 13th century. Caerlaverock Castle was built to control trade in early times.",
